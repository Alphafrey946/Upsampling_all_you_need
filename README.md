# Introduction 
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of artificial neural network that are designed to process data with a grid-like topology, such as images or videos. They are inspired by the structure of the visual cortex in the brain and are designed to automatically learn and identify features in images.  
One of the main challenges with CNNs is their lack of shift invariance property. This property becomes critical in high stake and crucual tasks.

-------------------------

# Motivation

As previously mentioned, the shift variance exhibited by CNNs can pose a significant challenge in high-stakes classification tasks, including medical imaging analysis, object detection in autonomous driving, and surveillance and security applications. This is because even a slight shift in input images can result in drastic changes in the output of the network.  
In these tasks, precise object localization is critical for accurate diagnosis, navigation, and identification, and the shift invariance property of CNNs allows them to recognize objects regardless of their position or orientation in an image. Examples of such applications include the detection and segmentation of tumors in medical images, the detection and classification of objects such as cars and pedestrians in autonomous driving scenarios, and facial recognition and object tracking in surveillance and security settings.
